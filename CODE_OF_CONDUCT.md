# Code of Conduct for Flexible Initramfs Project

Welcome to the Flexible Initramfs Project! This project aims to provide a modular, customizable initramfs solution for Linux on ARM and mobile devices. We strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for all contributors.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include GitHub issues/discussions, MEGA repositories, Discord/Telegram groups, and any other communication channels used for project coordination.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team via GitHub issues or direct message to maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly.

1. **First Offense**: Verbal warning and requirement to acknowledge the Code of Conduct
2. **Second Offense**: Temporary ban (1-4 weeks) from project spaces
3. **Third Offense**: Permanent ban from project spaces

Maintainers will mediate conflicts fairly and transparently. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct in good faith may be removed from the project team.
